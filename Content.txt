This is the content file for the project. It only excist to illustrate 
git operations.
So far so good. The reinstallation og Git was a succes. 
Git Init of this project was a succes!
Git Push of the project prompted for a logon using an access token. 
Something was wrong? An error message appeared and a form asking for git
username and password appeared. This seems like old fashion authentication
The next step is to try resetting the authentication.
Succes! It was possible to push with an active Access Token. Next step is to get git 
to remeber it! Lets try: git config --system credential.helper manager-core
This did not work. Try to find something online!
Okay we are ready to try Configre helper store. configuration done. Now 
lets see if we can push without beeing promted for username and pass word.
That seemed to work like a charm! Remeber to inspect the .git crential file. On the
local machine at work it is located at: H:\
Lets fix the small name problem! Okay Lets see how that went? It seems to work! This 
might be the end of this problem! Okay not quite! But what about now? Ready to test it!
Greetings from  machine at home. Lets make the first push! Well not sure if it uses the
token autentication? Lets try git config --system --unset credential.helper
