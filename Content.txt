This is the content file for the project. It only excist to illustrate 
git operations.
So far so good. The reinstallation og Git was a succes. 
Git Init of this project was a succes!
Git Push of the project prompted for a logon using an access token. 
Something was wrong? An error message appeared and a form asking for git
username and password appeared. This seems like old fashion authentication
The next step is to try resetting the authentication.
